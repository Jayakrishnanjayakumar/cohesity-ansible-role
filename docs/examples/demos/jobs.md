## Synopsis
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

This example play leverages the Ansible Inventory to dynamically remove and create Protection Jobs for existing Protection Sources.  The source file for this playbook is located at the root of the role in `examples/demos/jobs.yml`.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  This example play should be considered for demo purposes only.  This play removes and then registers all Physical, VMware, and GenericNAS Protection Jobs based on the Ansible Inventory.  There are no job validations or state checks to ensure that backups are not running.  If jobs are running, they will be canceled.  This action will **delete all backups** as part of the process.

#### How It Works
- The play starts by reading all environments from the Ansible Inventory and cancels any corresponding Protection Jobs if active.
- Upon completion of the job stop, the job is deleted, **including all backups**.
- After the job is successfully removed, Protection job is created with sources

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Before using this playbook, refer to the [Setup](../../setup.md) and [How to Use](../../how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

| Required | Parameters | Type | Choices/Defaults | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X | **var_cohesity_server** | String | | IP or FQDN for the Cohesity cluster |
| X | **var_cohesity_admin** | String | | Username with which Ansible will connect to the Cohesity cluster |
| X | **var_cohesity_password** | String | | Password belonging to the selected Username.  This parameter is not logged. |
|   | var_validate_certs | Boolean | False | Switch that determines whether SSL Validation is enabled. |

## Ansible Inventory Configuration
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

To fully leverage this Ansible Play, you must configure your Ansible Inventory file with certain keys and values. This makes it much easier to manage the overall experience. See [Configure Your Ansible Inventory](../configuring-your-ansible-inventory.md).

This is an example inventory file: (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
```ini
[workstation]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

[linux]
10.2.46.96
10.2.46.97
10.2.46.98
10.2.46.99

[linux:vars]
type=Linux
ansible_user=root

[windows]
10.2.45.88
10.2.45.89

[windows:vars]
type=Windows
ansible_user=administrator
ansible_password=secret
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore


# => Declare the VMware environments to manage.
[vmware]
10.2.x.x

[vmware:vars]
type=VMware
vmware_type=VCenter
source_username=administrator
source_password=password

# => Declare the GenericNas endpoints to manage
[generic_nas]
export_path endpoint="10.2.x.x:/export_path" nas_protocol=NFS
nas_share endpoint="\\\\10.2.x.x\\nas_share"
data endpoint="\\\\10.2.x.x\\data"

# => Default variables for GenericNas endpoints.
[generic_nas:vars]
type=GenericNas
nas_protocol=SMB
nas_username=.\cohesity
nas_password=password
```

## Customize Your Playbooks
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

The combined source file for these two playbooks is located at the root of the role in `examples/demos/jobs.yml`.

### Register Protection Job for all linux hosts in the inventory
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

Here is an example playbook that registers a new Protection Job for all Linux hosts in the inventory and starts the protection job run. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
> **Note:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../../setup.md) and [How to Use](../../how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

You can create a file called `protection_job_linux.yml`, add the contents from the sample playbook, and then run the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> protection_jobs_linux.yml -e "username=admin password=admin"
  ```

### Remove Protection Jobs for all GenericNAS hosts in the inventory
[top](#Create-and-Manage-Cohesity-Jobs-Using-Ansible-Inventory)

Here is an example playbook that stops the protection job run, removes the existing Protection Jobs and deletes the backups for all GenericNAS hosts in the inventory. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
> **Note:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../../setup.md) and [How to Use](../../how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

You can create a file called `remove_protection_jobs_GenericNAS.yml`, add the contents from the sample playbook, and then run the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> remove_protection_jobs_GenericNAS.yml -e "username=admin password=admin"
  ```

```yaml
# => Remove Protection Jobs for all GenericNAS hosts in the inventory
# =>
---
  - hosts: workstation
    # => Please change these variables to connect
    # => to your Cohesity Cluster
