# Cohesity Jobs management and creation using Ansible Inventory

## SYNOPSIS
This example play leverages the Ansible Inventory to dynamically manage and create Protection Jobs for existing Protection Sources.
- The play will start by reading all environments from the Ansible Inventory and cancel the corresponding Protection Job if active.
- Upon completion of the job stop, the job will be deleted **including all backups**.
- After the job is successfully removed, each source will be registered as a new Protection Job with the corresponding endpoint as the name of the Job created..

NOTE: This example play should be considered for demo purposes only.  This will remove and then register all Physical, VMware, and GenericNAS Protection Jobs based on the Ansible Inventory.  This action will **delete all backups** as part of the process.

### Notes
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
