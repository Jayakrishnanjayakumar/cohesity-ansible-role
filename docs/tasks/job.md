## Synopsis
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

Use this task to add and configure Cohesity Protection Sources.

#### How It Works
- The task starts by determining whether the named endpoint exists in the cluster.
- Upon validation, the task creates a new Protection Source (*state=present*) or removes the existing Protection Source (*state=absent*) from the cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  When *state=absent*, there are no job validations or state checks to ensure that backups are not running. If jobs exist for the Source, an error is raised and the task fails.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible version 2.6 or higher
  * The [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a system running one of the following UNIX operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, or any of the BSDs. Windows is not supported for the Control Machine.
* Python version 2.6 or higher

> **Notes:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Before using this task, refer to the [Setup](../setup.md) and [How to Use](../how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see [Cohesity Protection Job](/modules/cohesity_job.md?id=syntax).
```yaml
cohesity_protection:
  state: present
  job_name: ""
  endpoint: ""
  environment: ""
  storage_domain: DefaultIddStorageDomain
  policy: Bronze
  delete_backups: False
  cancel_active: False
```
## Customize Your Playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This example shows how to include the Cohesity Ansible Role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task as part of the delivery.

### Create new Physical Protection Job using the Ansible Inventory
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This is an example playbook that creates a new Protection Job for all Physical hosts based on the registered inventory hostname. (Remember to change it to suit your environment.)
> **Notes:**
  - Before using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](../setup.md) and [How to Use](../how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.
  - This example requires that the endpoint matches an existing Protection Source.  See [Task: Cohesity Protection Source Management](tasks/source.md).
